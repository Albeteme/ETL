# ETL

This is a project I worked on to practice my skills on ETL.
I extracted a couple of datasets from kaggle about the job openings landscape for data scientists/ data analysts over the states. After extraction, I proceeded to clean them up in pandas. I then merged both datasets to pull the information I needed such as the best paid jobs, the top job tiles  based on salary and location.
I was then able to load the merged dataset into a database using pgAdmin in Postgre.
